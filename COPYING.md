## Why AGPL-3.0?

### Protection Against Unauthorized Commercial Use

The AGPL-3.0 license specifically addresses the "SaaS loophole" that exists in other open source licenses:

**Problem with MIT/Apache:**
```
Someone copies your code
    ↓
Runs it as a web service
    ↓
Makes money from ads
    ↓
Never shares improvements
    ↓
You get nothing 😢
```

**Solution with AGPL-3.0:**
```
Someone copies your code
    ↓
Runs it as a web service
    ↓
MUST share complete source code
    ↓
MUST use AGPL-3.0 license
    ↓
Community benefits ✅
```

### Real-World Impact

Companies that want to use AGPL code without sharing typically have two options:

1. **Comply with AGPL** - Share their source code (most won't do this)
2. **Buy a commercial license** - Pay you for a non-AGPL version
3. **Don't use it** - Build their own (expensive)

This effectively prevents casual copying while allowing legitimate open source use.
